### Application Building

We run a app development agency called Betalectic (Building Beta Version of your apps, Eclectically.), You can check our website is [betalectic.com](https://betalectic.com)

If you need help in building any of following you can contact us at [@betalectic](https://twitter.com/betalectic):

- Websites
- Web Applications like User/Admin Dashboards
- Mobile Applications using React Native
- Backend APIs and Solutions using NodeJS

### Hosted Solutions

As we are developing applications for our clients, we see lot of newer ways to save time/effort, in turn reducing the support/maintenance needed. In our vision to develop apps faster, we proactively build solutions.

Some of those solutions, though can be open-sourced, doesn't make sense for us to do the same. Because to use those open-source projects, developers end-up hosting and maintaining them, and not to mention, scale them. We put all those solutions together under one company called Teurons.

So, we build/maintain and deploy to cloud (to multiple regions across the world). You can find those solutions and used them for free and for subscription at [teurons.com](https://teurons.com)

### Open Source

Well, it's no fun if we don't give back. But, we don't do it just for the sake of giving back. It agains helps us build apps faster.

**Frontend Concerns**

We have and are abstracting React and React Native Components. You can find all those at: [@reusejs](https://twitter.com/reusejs)

**Backend Concerns**

To make our work faster and better, we use a custom developed framework called NobeJS (Node + Beta). You can find all those at: [@nobejs](https://twitter.com/nobejs)

## Credits

This blog is built using [Syntax](https://tailwindui.com/templates/syntax) template from Tailwind - which uses Markdoc from Stripe. I have changed it very little.
